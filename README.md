    CECS 326 - Project 1

    For Project 1, we tackled one problem at a time:

    For Problem 1: 
        We decided to create 2 files, QuoteClient.java & QuoteServer.java. 
            These 2 files will talk to each other where the client talks with the server and vice versa.
            
        The way to run these 2 files is first to run the QuoteServer.java file
            We do this so the server is active and the QuoteClient file has something to talk to.
            
        Next, we run QuoteClient.java which will give us the quote of the day.
            In this case, we entered the quote: "Always smile :)" which should be displayed when the files are run in that order.
            

    For Problem 2:
        We decided to create 2 files, EchoClient.java & EchoServer.java. 
            These 2 files will talk to each other where the client talks with the server and vice versa.
            
        The way to run these 2 files is first to run the EchoServer.java file
            We do this so the server is active and the QuoteClient file has something to talk to.
            In order to verify if the EchoServer file is talking to the EchoClient file, we include the saying: "Hello there! I am the server." 
            
        Next, we run QuoteClient.java which will give us the quote of the day.
            In this case, we entered the quote: "Always smile :)" which should be displayed when the files are run in that order.
            In order to verify if the EchoClient file is talking to the EchoServer file, we include the saying: "Hello there! I am the client." 

        If the 2 files are able to run and speak to each other the response is that:
            EchoClient will print out the output: "Received from server: 'Hello there! I am the client." 
            This shows that the 2 files were connected to each other to verify that problem 2 does work
